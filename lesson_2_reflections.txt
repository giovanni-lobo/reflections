What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    When I initialize a repository it creates a Git repository folder with a .git directory
that contains this Git history metadata. It has to be created to store files and files changes
history.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
    The staging area contains only those files to be committed, while working directory
    has all files and repository contains commited files and history data. It helps to identify
    files that should be worked.
