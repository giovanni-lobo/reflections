When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
  You can use a remote repository to have "broad" access to it, to share your work with
  community and also for getting contributions to your code.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  In order not to pull uninteresting updates to your repository
